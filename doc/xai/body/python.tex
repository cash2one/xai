This chapter will introduce the Python techniques used in XAI.

\section{Modify Module file} % (fold)
When AI learn new things, it need to modify the module file. For example, "yellow skin" means the skin has a property called "yellow". We will add self.properties.append("yellow")
 in the Skin class file. That means the module file \_skin.py has to change while new knowledge is added. The module file can be changed in different way:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item add new data
	\item modify old function
	\item add new function
\end{enumerate}
The most important future of a class definition is that the content of a class is the collection of functions, and the order of the function does not matter, because self are used.
